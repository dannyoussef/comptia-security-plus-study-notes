# 2.1 Explain the importance of security concepts in an enterprise environment.
* **Configuration management**
    * **Diagrams:** visual representations aiding in understanding system architectures, network topologies, and security controls.
    * **Baseline configuration:** a set of specifications for an information system or configuration item that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control procedures.
    * **Standard naming conventions:** consistent and standardized naming conventions.
    * **Internet protocol (IP) schema:** well-organized IP addressing to simplify network management.
* **Data sovereignty:** the idea that data are subject to the laws and governance structures of the nation where they are collected.
* **Data protection**
    * **Data loss prevention (DLP):** refers to the strategies, processes, and technologies cybersecurity teams use to protect sensitive data from theft, loss, and misuse.
    * **Masking:** the process of modifying sensitive data in such a way that is is of no or little value to unauthorized intruders while still being usable by software or authorized personnel.
    * **Encryption:** the security method of encoding data from plaintext to ciphertext.
    * **At rest:** the state of data when it is stored, rather from moving one place to another.
    * **In transit/motion:** refers data that flows between systems.
    * **In processing:** refers to data as it is being processed.
    * **Tokenization:** the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent (token) that has no intrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.
    * **Rights management:** the use of technology to control and manage copyrighted material.
* **Geographical considerations:** ensures compliance with data protection laws related to the storage and processing of data in specific geographic locations.
* **Response and recovery controls:** organized strategic approach to detecting and managing cyber attacks in ways that minimize damage, recovery time, and total costs.
* **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) Inspection:** the process of intercepting and reviewing encrypted internet communication traffic.
* **Hashing:** the practice of transforming a given key or string of characters into another value for the purpose of security.
* **API Considerations:** securing APIs through authentication, authorization, and encryption to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
* **Site resiliency**
    * **Hot site:** an off-premises location where an organization can resume normal operations in the event of an information system disruption.
    * **Cold site:** a backup facility that has the necessary electrical and physical components of a computer facility, but does not have the computer equipment in place.
    * **Warm site:** an environmentally conditioned work space that is partially equipped with information systems and telecommunications equipment to support relocated operations in the event of a significant disruption.
* **Deception and disruption**
    * **Honeypots:** a system or system resource that is designed to be attractive to potential crackers and intruders.
    * **Honeyfiles:** bait files intended for hackers to access.
    * **Honeynets:** a network of decoy computer systems that are used to lure in attackers and gather threat intelligence.
    * **Fake telemetry:** contains decoy or faked telemetry data that can be used to entice attackers while simultaneously capturing data on and about the attack.
    * **DNS sinkhole:** a mechanism aimed at protecting users by intercepting DNS requests attempting to connect to known malicious or unwanted domains and return a false, or rather controlled IP address.
