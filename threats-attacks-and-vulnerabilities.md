# 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques.
* **Phishing:** a digital form of social engineering to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information.
* **Smishing:** the fraudulent practice of sending text messages that appear to be from reputable companies in order to persuade individuals to reveal personal information.
* **Vishing:** a hacking technique of defrauding targets over the phone, enticing them to divulge sensitive information
* **Spam:** the abuse of electronic messaging systems to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages.
* **Spam over instant messaging (SPIM):** specific type of unsolicited spam that is delivered via instant messaging.
* **Spear phishing:** a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or organizations through malicious emails.
* **Dumpster diving:** a way for attacks to gain sensitive information by searching through a victim's trash.
* **Shoulder surfing:** a type of social engineering technique where the attacker can obtain information by physically viewing the victim's device screen and keypad.
* **Pharming:** online fraud that involves the use of malicious code to direct victims to spoofed websites in an attempt to steal their credentials and data.
* **Tailgating:** a type of social engineering technique where an attacker follows an unaware user to gain access to an area without authorization.
* **Eliciting information:** the subtle extraction of information during an apparently normal and innocent conversation.
* **Whaling:** a common cyber attack that occurs when an attacker utilizes spear phishing methods to go after large, high-profile targets.
* **Prepending:** the technique where malicious characters or code are added at the beginning of a legitimate file, string, or command.
* **Identity Fraud:** all types of crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception.
* **Invoice scams:** tricking recipients into believing they have been charged for a service, so they call the number and reveal sensitive personally identifiable information.
* **Credential harvesting:** a cyberattack technique where cybercriminals gather user credentials.
* **Reconaissance:** the process of gathering information about a system to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Hoax:** a message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat, in an attempt to trick or defraud someone.
* **Impersonation:** an attack type targeted phishing attack where a malicious actor pretends to be someone else or other entities to steal sensitive data.
* **Watering hole attack:** a targeted attack designed to compromise users within a specific industry or group of users by infecting websites they typically visit and luring them to a malicious site.
* **Typosquatting:** a form of cybersquatting (sitting on sites under someone else's brand or copyright) that targets Internet users who incorrectly type a website address into their web browser.
* **Pretexting:** a form of social engineering in which an attacker gets access to information, a system, or a service through deceptive means, such as fabricating plausible stories.
* **Influence campaigns** refers to a large-scale campaign launched by a threat actor, or group of threat actors, with a lot of power (e.g., hacktivist group, nation-state actor, or terrorist group) that seeks to shift public opinion.
    * **Hybrid warfare:** a type of warfare that uses conventional and unconvential means. A campaign might use tactics like espionage, hacking, and spreading disinformation or fake news.
    * **Social media:** can be used by threat actors to push their narrative and affect public opinion. Bots and armies of posters (sometimes using hacked accounts) may post messages that repeat or reinforce the hoaxes or false narrative pushed by influence campaigns.
* **Principles (reasons for effectiveness)**
    * **Authority:** directed by someone impersonating an authority figure or falsely citing their authority .
    > Example: "I'm the CEO calling."
    * **Intimidation:** to frighten and coerce by threat.
    > Example: "If you don't reset my password, I will call your supervisor."
    * **Consensus:** when a social engineer claims that an action is normal or generally accepted within the context of the attack (i.e., social proof).
    > Example: "Karen, from IT, emailed me those same files last week."
    * **Scarcity:** when an attacker claims that there is a limited supply.
    > Example: "The next 50 people to donate Bitcoin will have their Bitcoin doubled!"
    * **Familiarity:** an attacker takes advantage or exploits a target by introducing that target to something familiar.
    * **Trust:** an attacker may gain the victim's trust to tick them into completing some request.
    * **Urgency:** luring and rushing victims to complete a request by expressing that immediate action is needed.
    > Example: "I need those files, my meeting with the board starts in 5 minutes."
